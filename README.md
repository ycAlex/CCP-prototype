# CCP-prototype
These are for CCP prototypes which made by Django

The python version is 3.6.1 and Django version is 1.11.1

The prototypes made during each sprint, but has been pushed at the due day of final submission

I also post the database, because that may make the test easier

For each prototype run->"python manage.py createsuperuser" to create superuser
run->"python manage.py runserver" to start

The urls for each prototype please view the readMe in each prototype or report
