Forms and validation code for user registration.

Note that all of these forms assume your user model is similar in
structure to Django's default User class. If your user model is
significantly different, you may need to write your own form class;
see the documentation for notes on custom user models with
django-registration.

    Form for registering a new user account.

    the ``commit=False`` argument, as several registration workflows
